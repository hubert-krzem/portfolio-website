                <h2>FPL Live Notifications</h2>
                <p>Fantasy premier league is played by over 12 million players. Yet the official app doesnâ€™t support live notifications for in game events.
                    I created an app that tracks the official FPL API and sends out push notifications whenever a users points are updated. By tracking the official API, the app can push out accurate updates that reflect the real state of a users team.
                    This allows users to be better informed on how their team is performing in real time and helps new players understand what in game events actually mean for their scores.
