                <p>Fantasy premier league is played by over 12 million players. Yet the official app doesnâ€™t support live notifications for in game events. <br></br>
                    <br></br>I created an app that tracks the official FPL API and sends out push notifications whenever a users points are updated. By tracking the official API, the app can push out accurate updates that reflect the real state of a users team. <br></br>
                    <br></br>This allows users to be better informed on how their team is performing in real time and helps new players understand what in game events actually mean for their scores.
